## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Both vehicle length and ground clearance have no impact on gas mileage. 

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- No, it is not considered zero, the p-value is smaller than 0.05.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- Since the Adjusted R-squared is 0.6825, that means these variables explain 68.25% of the gas mileage
